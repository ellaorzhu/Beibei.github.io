    <h1> A page is about Cat</h1>
	<div class="left">
   <p id="first">The domestic cat[1][2] (Felis catus or Felis silvestris catus)[2][4] is a small, usually furry, domesticated, and carnivorous mammal. They are often called housecats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines.[6] Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt vermin.
   
Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears
<p>Since cats were venerated in <span class="text1"style="color:red">ancient Egypt</span>, they were commonly believed to have been domesticated there,[11] but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago (7,500 BC).[12] A genetic study in 2007 concluded that domestic cats are
 descended from <span class="text2"style="color:red">African</span> wildcats (Felis silvestris lybica),having diverged around 8,000 BC in <span class="text3" style="color:red">West Asia</span>.[11][13] Cats are the most popular pet in the world, and are now found in almost every place where humans live.[14]</p>
